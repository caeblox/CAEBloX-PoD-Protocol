# Similarity-Analyzer
The Similarity-Analyzer is an advanced geometry similarity scoring system built to support the minting process for CAEBlox, a platform focused on verifying 3D geometries Similarity. This tool automates the evaluation of 3D STL files, leveraging Signed Distance Function (SDF) to deliver highly accurate similarity scoring between Network designs.
